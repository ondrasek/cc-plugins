# Per-edit hook: runs gofumpt + goimports on changed Go files
# Triggered by PostToolUse on Edit|Write
# Exit 0 = success (fixes applied silently)
# Exit 2 = unfixable issues fed back to Claude (fail-fast: one error at a time)
#
# THIS IS AN ANNOTATED EXAMPLE. gofumpt and goimports are the standard Go
# formatters. The setup skill should verify they're available. What matters
# is the PATTERN:
#   - Detect Go file from tool input JSON
#   - Run auto-fixers silently (exit 0 if all fixed)
#   - FAIL-FAST: stop at the first unfixable error, report only that one
#   - Structured output: check name, command, tool output, hint, action directive
